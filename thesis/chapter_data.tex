    What follows is a description of the process of image annotation for use in the machine learning algorithm to detect cells. The image annotation, as required by Arteta's \cite{arteta12} algorithm, are dots on each cell of the image. The algorithm uses these dots as positive examples, and all the remaining pixels as negative examples of a cell.
    
    We have annotated a subset of frames on the Lung dataset provided by Dr. Leo Carlin. The entire dataset is composed of 150 frames, and is divided into two channels, one for each type of cell (\todo{I need to learn more about the types of cells I am tracking}). We have marked 10 cropped frames on each channel (frame 1, 14, 25, 46, 81, 115, 131, 143 and 150) of dimensions about $128\times118$ pixels.
    
    The annotation was performed using a Fiji \cite{fiji12} tool called PointPicker \cite{thevanez14} which is accessible from \(Analyse/Tools/PointPicker\). The annotation is done by manually clicking on each identified cell.The tool outputs a $txt$ file containing $x$ and $y$ coordinates of each annotation, the image number, as well as some other metadata that is not important for us.

    It must be noted that the images are very noisy, and it is often hard to distinguish cells from non cells. Figure \ref{fig:annotation_image} displays an example of an image that was annotated. It is therefore questionable how accurately the learning method will be able to learn the idea of a cell, given that the annotations are far from perfect. It would have been much easier to perform the learning using a synthetic dataset.
    
    The data is then loaded into MATLAB and converted into the format required by the algorithm. The data tidying is performed by the script \textit{prepareTrainData.m}.
