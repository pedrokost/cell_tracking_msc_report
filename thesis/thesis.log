Class scrreprt Warning: \float@addtolists detected!

(scrreprt)              deprecated in KOMA-Script v3.01 2008/11/14 and
(scrreprt)              has been replaced by more several more flexible
(scrreprt)              features of package `tocbasic`.
(scrreprt)              Since Version 3.12 support for deprecated
(scrreprt)              \float@addtolist interface has been
(scrreprt)              restricted to only some of the KOMA-Script
(scrreprt)              features and been removed from others.
(scrreprt)              Loading of package `scrhack' may help to
(scrreprt)              avoid this warning, if you are using a
