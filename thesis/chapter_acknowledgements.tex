\chapter*{Acknowledgement}

I would like to acknowledge a number of individuals that have supported me throughout this project or in some way or another contributed to the development of the automatic cell tracker presented in this report.

First, I give my sincerest gratitude to my supervisor, Ben Glocker, for his continuous feedback, guidance and contagious motivation for the project. 

Second, I would like to thank Dr. Leo Carlin for seeding the initial idea for the project as well as providing all the image sequences used to train and evaluate the system. I would also like to thank him for carefully reviewing the training datasets.

Third, I give my thanks to my friend Diego Aranda PÃ©rez for his help in annotating the training image sequences as well as helping me stay focused, especially in the initial weeks of the project.

Fourth, my friend Stefan McCarthy for proofreading this report.

Fifth, Carlos Arteta for making publicly available the original code from his research. His cell detection code has been reused in this project and allowed me to focus on the development of the cell tracking module.

Most of all, I give my thanks to my parents and brothers, for their guidance and support during the first two decades of my life.
