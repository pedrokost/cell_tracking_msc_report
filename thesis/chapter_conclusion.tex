\section{Conclusion \statusnew}
\label{sec:conclusion_conclusion}

- rewrite about importance of cell tracking

- write that it's 3 months 


- what problem we tried to solve

- how we approached the problem

- what this is

- what were the main contributions

- how were the results

- what were the weak and which the strong points: it can work for any point objects. may not work well to close large gaps. The problem of closing large gaps.



\section{Future work \statusnew1}
\label{sec:conclusion_futurework}

image stabilization. problem and what would ipmrove

denoising process

skipping bad frames as a preprocessing step

outputs that analyse the data... but can be done with external software

tracker: experiment with multiclass classifier, taht is dependent on the distance of the closing gaps

windowed approach to be able to handle tens thousands of frames

- faster implementation

- better define the initialization, termination and FP probabilities, to elimintate the need of parameters that can be adjusted.

- a gui for the tracker
