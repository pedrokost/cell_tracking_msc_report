Hello everybody!

My name is Pedro Kostelec and in this short presentation I am going to present you the work I've been working on in the past 4 months. Throughout the project I have been supervised by professor Ben Glocker, and working in collaboration with Dr. Leo Carlin.

Let me start by telling you a purely fictional story. While the characters of the story are inspired by real people, the story itself is a skewed reality. 

4 months ago I met a scientist called Dr. Leo. Today, he's a researcher at the National Lung and Hurt Institute, but this wasn't always the case. Hear me out. 

When he was a child, Dr. Leo had an obscure hobby that many of his friends deemed ____: he was obsessed with the study of mice. He spent many nights awake observing the rodents, watching them run in windmills, and drawing sketches of their limbs, head and body. As the years went by, he started a study of their internal organs, observing for example how food was progressing from the mouth, through the ___, into the stomach and so on.

As more years went by, Dr. Leo became an expert on mice. He knew everything about their behavior, the working of their internal organs, etc. When he started becoming bored of all that, his curiosity drew him deeper, and he started observing the cells moving through the blood? network.

One night, he sneaked into the lab and store a laser scanner (TODO) from the lab and started taking pictures of the cells, especially around the lung and liver. You might be wondering by now, how many of these rodents had been sacrificed to satisfy his curiosity. When I asked him this question, he smiled and showed me his imaging method.

First of all, certain cells in his mice were marked with a fluorescent reporter that the mouse had been genetically modified to produce just in specific type of immune cells. Before starting, the mouse is anesthetized. A mechanical ventilator is used to compensate for the dorming lungs and the surface of the lung is exposed surgically. Then a specialized “vacuum chamber” is used to stably hold a glass coverslip against the surface of the lung. The alveoli, alveolar capillaries and associated cells can then be visualized by laser scanning confocal microscopy.

The same apparatus can be used to interrogate other organs without mechanical
ventilation, e.g. the liver.

This complicated system, put in place to facilitate the "reuse" of mice, is able to produce images that look like this:

- show 2 short sequences of cells

Dr. Leo wanted to know how these cells move and why the mouse needs them in the first place. Somewhere he learned that these specific cells, called neutrophils, are part of the immuno-defensive system, and reduce inflammation. A reduction in their number could dangerously harm or even kill the mice. Since they appeared to be so important, he started quantifying their behavior by manually measuring their displacement.

As you can imagine, this became very boring very quickly as the number of images never seemed to reduce. So, he turned to Google for help and he found some software too help him do the tracking of cells.

But the results he got were unsatisfying. Why? Let us look at the image sequences again.

- TODO: show a few difficulties with the image sequences

Briefly, the software wasn't designed to track cells in images with these kind of artefacts.

So Dr. Leo gave up on the software, and started looking for a postgraduate student to delegate the boring, manual work of measuring how the cells move, while he could focus on more important parts of his research.

Unlucky me, I was the first student he came across. So now we are back at to the day we first met and he just finished telling me his story. Since I was a postgraduate student (and since students have nothing better to do) he asked me to the the manual work for him.

I knew this was a trap. If I agreed to analyze some of his images, sooner or later he would come back and ask me for more.
