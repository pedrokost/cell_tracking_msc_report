# Learning to detect and track cell in micropic imaging

## Introduction (get motivated)

2 slides:

- why is cell tracking important
- what were the objectives of the project

## Data (understand the difficulty of the problem)

5 slides:

- how is it obtained
- some basic examples
- some complex examples: and explain the difficulties

## Related work (why these methods?)

2 slides:

- 1 slide to review all the detection methods
- Why have we chosen the machine learning approach
- 1 slide to review all the tracking methods
- Why have we chosen the global data association approach

## Detection of cells (robust: learning approach)

2 slides:

- 1 slide to explain the extraction of candidate cells and the voting
- 1 slide to explain the benefits and pitfalls

## Tracking of cells (cool: global + learning)

4 slides:

- Brief overview of the process
- How are the robust tracklets generated
- The linking of robust tracklets
	- The hypothesis + assumptions + optimal decision

## Experimental results

4 slides:

- Show precision and recall values of detector for each dataset
- Show examples of generated trajectories
- Show examples where it performed great (bad examples as well)

## Conclusion and future work

1 slides:

- have we achieved our objectives?
- can the results be improved?
- is the method promising?
